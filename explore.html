      <p>Sea turtle conservation volunteering in Sri Lanka is the ultimate way to experience the teardrop-shaped island that is home to five of the seven existing sea turtle species. 
          Sri Lanka's several nesting beaches, unfortunately, need consistent supervision, to protect the nests from poachers of any kind. Discover this unique country, get to know a new culture and do your bit to save the marine environment at the same time.<br>

          As a sea turtle conservation volunteer in Sri Lanka, your main purpose is to protect baby turtles, their nests and to provide for their overall well-being in the hatcheries. 
          Patrol the beaches, protect nests, care for baby turtles in Sri Lanka and release healed turtles into the Indian ocean.<br>
          The shells of the turtles and tortoises differ, assisting them in their respective habitats; the top part of the turtleâ€™s shell is streamlined and short to make swimming easy, while the tortoise has a thicker shell for its protection on land. 
          turtles have broad, flattened flippers facilitate swimming greatly but make it very difficult for females to move on the beaches where they come back to nest, while tortoises have short cylindrical limbs.</p><br><br></div>

            <p>Sri Lanka is one of the best places to volunteer with sea turtles. Why? The teardrop-shaped island is home to five of the seven existing sea turtle species.
              Come delve into the colorful Sri Lankan world and give back to the local communities by supporting their sea turtle conservation work!<br>
              Sea turtles have been around for millions of years. When T-Rex and his dinosaur friends ruled planet Earth,These marvelous creatures were already gliding through our oceans. 
              Despite their ancient existence, sea turtles are extremely vulnerable to natural and man-made threats
