            <h1>Turtles of Sri Lanka</h1>
	<p>Among the 250 species of turtles on Earth, seven of them live in the ocean (called sea turtles), and the remaining 243 species live on land (terrestrial turtles called tortoises) or in freshwater ponds and marshes. Five of the seven species of sea turtles – the Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas), Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), Olive Ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea), Loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) – visit the Sri Lankan shores to nest.
         Three species of freshwater turtles – Parker’s Black Turtle (Melanochelys trijuga pakeri) Sri Lanka Black Turtle (Melanochelys trijuga thermalis) and the Soft or Flapshell turtle (Lissemys punctata punctata) – and one terrestrial tortoise, the Star tortoise (Geochelone elegans), can also be found in Sri Lanka</p>

                             <p>The green sea turtle is the largest hard-shelled sea turtle. They are unique among sea turtles in that they are herbivores, eating mostly seagrasses and algae.Green turtles are found throughout the world. They nest in over 80 countries and live in the coastal areas of more than 140 countries. Historically, green turtles were exploited for their fat, meat and eggs, causing global population declines. Many countries, including the United States, prohibit the killing of sea turtles and collection of their eggs. However, in some areas, the killing of green turtles for their meat or to supply shells to the wildlife trafficking trade remains a threat to their recovery. </p>

                <p >The leatherback sea turtle is the largest turtle in the world. They are the only species of sea turtle that lack scales and a hard shell. They are named for their tough rubbery skin and have existed in their current form since the age of the dinosaurs.
                    Leatherbacks are highly migratory, some swimming over 10,000 miles a year between nesting and foraging grounds. They are also accomplished divers with the deepest recorded dive reaching nearly 4,000 feet—deeper than most marine mammals.

 <h4>Olive ridley sea turtle</h4>
                
                    <img src="Images/Oli.jpeg" alt="Olive ridley sea turtle"/>
                <p>The olive ridley gets its name from the olive green color of its heart-shaped shell.
                    The species is among the smallest of the world’s sea turtles and is found primarily in the tropical regions of the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans.<br>
                    Olive ridley turtles are found throughout the world. The number of olive ridleys are greatly reduced from historical estimates (for example, 10 million olive ridleys in the Pacific Ocean), due to overexploitation for turtle meat and eggs. 
                     Bycatch in fishing gear and the direct harvest of turtles and eggs are the biggest threat facing olive ridleys

                    <img src="Images/HS.jpeg" alt="Hawksbill Turtle"/>
                <p>Hawksbill sea turtles inhabit the tropical and sub-tropical waters of all of the world’s major oceans.
                     Hawksbills get their name from their unique beak-like mouth, which resembles that of a hawk and is perfect for finding food sources in hard-to-reach cracks and crevices
                     They are the only species of sea turtle that can survive on a diet consisting mainly of sponges. Hawksbill turtles play a key role in the function of marine ecosystems.<br>
                    In many parts of the world, hawksbills face the unique threat of being hunted for their beautiful shell, also known as “tortoise shell”, which is used by craftspeople to create many types of jewelry and trinkets. The historical hunting and killing of hawksbills for their shell nearly drove the species to extinction. 
                   Today, the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) forbids the trade of any turtle products on the international market, including hawksbill tortoise shell, but illegal hunting continues to represent a threat to the species in many parts of the world.
